# Privacy Policy for Scrum Tools Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** August 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Scrum Tools Chrome Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and stores information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a transparent approach to data handling.

## 1. Introduction

The Scrum Tools Chrome Extension is designed to assist users with daily Scrum ceremonies by providing a timer and team member management features directly within their Chrome browser. This Extension operates with a strong commitment to user privacy.

## 2. Data Collection

The Extension collects **no personal identifying information (PII)** about its users.

The only data collected by the Extension is **user-generated content** necessary for its core functionality:

*   **Timer Settings:** This includes the selected duration for the timer (e.g., 3 minutes, 5 minutes) and the current state of the timer (e.g., paused time, end time if running).
*   **Team Member Data:** This includes the names of team members added by the user and their associated status (e.g., "done" or "not done").

**We do NOT collect:**
*   Your browsing history or activity.
*   Any personal information such as your name, email address, IP address, or location.
*   Any data from websites you visit.
*   Any sensitive personal data.

## 3. Data Storage

All data collected by the Extension, as described in Section 2, is stored **locally on your device** within your Chrome browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`).

*   **No Cloud Storage:** Your data is never transmitted to our servers, third-party servers, or any external cloud service.
*   **Persistence:** Data stored locally persists across browser sessions and when the Extension's side panel is closed and reopened.

## 4. Data Usage

The data collected and stored locally is used **solely for the purpose of providing the functionality of the Scrum Tools Chrome Extension**.

*   **Timer Functionality:** Timer settings are used to manage the countdown and display the correct time.
*   **Team Member Management:** Team member names and statuses are used to display and manage your team list within the Extension.

## 5. Data Sharing

**We do NOT share any data collected by the Extension with third parties.**

Since all data is stored locally on your device, there is no data to share.

## 6. Data Security

The security of your locally stored data is managed by your Chrome browser's built-in local storage mechanisms. While we take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the Extension itself, the ultimate security of data stored on your device is dependent on the security of your device and browser.

## 7. User Control Over Data

You have full control over the data stored by the Extension on your device:

*   **Deletion:** You can clear the Extension's data by:
    *   Using the "Reset" functionality within the Extension (if available for specific features).
    *   Clearing your browser's local storage for the Extension.
    *   Uninstalling the Extension from your Chrome browser, which will automatically remove all associated local data.
*   **Access:** You can inspect the data stored by the Extension using your browser's developer tools (e.g., in Chrome, right-click on the side panel, select "Inspect", go to "Application" tab, then "Local Storage").

## 8. Children's Privacy

The Scrum Tools Chrome Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. As no personal information is collected, this section primarily serves as a notice.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
